# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately **5-6 hours** on the coding test. This includes setting up the project, implementing core features (task adding, searching, filtering), and styling the user interface to enhance the overall user experience.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

One of the most useful features introduced in recent versions of **JavaScript (ES2021)** is the **logical assignment operators** (`&&=`, `||=`, `??=`). These operators provide a concise way to perform logical operations combined with assignment, reducing boilerplate code.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Logical OR Assignment (||=)
let settings = { theme: 'light' };
settings.theme ||= 'dark';
console.log(settings.theme); // Output: 'light'

// Logical AND Assignment (&&=)
let isAuthenticated = true;
isAuthenticated &&= checkUserAuthentication();
console.log(isAuthenticated);

// Nullish Coalescing Assignment (??=)
let username = null;
username ??= 'Guest';
console.log(username); // Output: 'Guest'
## 3 How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Monitoring and Logging:

Set up monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Google Cloud Monitoring to identify performance bottlenecks.
Use logging (e.g., Winston in Node.js) to capture detailed information about slow processes.
Performance Profiling:

Use Chrome DevTools or React DevTools to analyze the performance of the client-side application, checking for issues like long tasks, unnecessary re-renders, or memory leaks.
For server-side issues, utilize Node.js Profiler or Flamegraphs to analyze CPU and memory usage.
Database Analysis:

Check for slow queries using SQL Profiler or database monitoring tools like pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL).
Optimize queries, add indexes, or use caching mechanisms like Redis if needed.
Real User Monitoring (RUM):

Analyze real user interactions with tools like Google Analytics, Sentry, or Raygun to see where users experience slowdowns.




4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
Given more time, I would consider adding the following features and improvements:

1. User Authentication and Authorization:
Implement user login and registration using JWT tokens or OAuth to allow multiple users to manage their tasks securely.
2. Persistent Data Storage:
Connect the app to a backend API (e.g., Node.js + Express) with a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for persistent task storage, enabling data to be retained across sessions.
3. Task Categories and Tags:
Allow users to categorize tasks with custom tags (e.g., Work, Personal) and filter tasks by category for better organization.
4. Drag and Drop Functionality:
Integrate a drag-and-drop feature using React Beautiful DnD to allow users to reorder tasks easily.
5. Notifications and Reminders:
Add a notification system to remind users of upcoming tasks, using browser notifications or email reminders.
6. Enhanced UI and Theme Options:
Provide multiple themes (light, dark) and allow users to customize the UI to their preference.
7. Offline Support:
Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features to enable offline usage, allowing users to manage tasks without an internet connection.
